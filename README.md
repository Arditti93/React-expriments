## Experimenting With React 

Developing my React JS skils with a few small projects 

1. Simple counter incrementer 
2. The Counter implements an incrementer and decrementer function
3. Address book stored in an array that allows the user to input a new contact and number to the array
4. To do list that allows the user to input tasks and dates and remove them once completed


Code can be found in src/App.js
